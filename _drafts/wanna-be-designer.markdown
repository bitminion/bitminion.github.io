Twitter bootstrap

mmalex, only use 3rd party css if I understand what it is doing

years of writing tools, UX challenges.
Functionality over usability.
Bootstrap and the web as a platform has changed that.

so-simple
hyde
landon
desire to be fluent in css, find it useful/powerful/easy
desire to write styleguides, use them, maintain them, adhere to them.
PPP3 is a great document
this site looks like garbage, default jekyll
