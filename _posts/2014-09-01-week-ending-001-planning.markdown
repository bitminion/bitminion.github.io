A few weeks ago I wrote a long list of ideas down on paper. I really want to work on programming projects outside of work, and I really want to practice writing prose, rather than only writing code.

So I started writing a long list, all about the type of game I would like to make. As it turned out, the list turned out to be a bunch of ideas about how to make a game, and it failed to talk about anything game related at all. Oh well!

Here is the list:



You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
