A few weeks ago I wrote a long list of ideas down on paper. I really want to work on programming projects outside of work, and I really want to practice writing prose, rather than only writing code.

So I started writing a long list, all about the type of game I would like to make. As it turned out, the list turned out to be a bunch of ideas about how to make a game, and it failed to talk about anything game related at all. Oh well!

Here is the list:

*	Browser LBP
*	HTML, CSS, Javascript
*	Platform interfaces / abstractions
*	Promises, async
*	Accounts w/ external identity
*	Persistent, sync, multiplayer, deterministic, replays
*	Tests. unit & functional
*	Share: tutorials, challenges, perfect/secret endings
*	Forums, feedback on everything, karma
*	Bounties & voting on development
*	0 iteration time
*	Always, CT, downtime = new test
*	Touch controls
*	Tutorial (PVZ, heartstone, dota2)
*	Opt-in feature branches
*	QA via forums/karma?
*	Offline app
*	Development notes, times
*	Public API
*	Forking / Merging assets. Authors. Attribution

Also, I made a little roadmap list:

1.	JFDI. Something running, all garbage
2.	Hosting garbage, CI/deployed
3.	Write it down. Blog about it
4.	Test the garbage, Example unit and functional test
