When I started writing this down in my planning notebook, the first build (build 0001) was called bare minimum and was all about a spinning cube and some UI.

Since then my priorities have changed and I'm starting with by writing prose, not code.  So! the build notes for my first build are:

*	Static HTML
*	Jekyll, github.io
*	alicebartlett.co.uk
*	JFDI post.
